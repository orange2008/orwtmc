# This blog stopped running.

## You should move to [https://blogger.orwtmc.top](https://blogger.orwtmc.top) right now. We will no longer publish posts on this site, but on that site hosted by Google.

### If you are in China, don't worry about that, we used Cloudflare to host our domain, it has CDN(Content Delivery Network), it has a cache to cache our pages, so you are accessing our cache. That also means you cannot read our latest post very early, because cache needs to be refreshed manually or a long time later. So I **STRONGLY** recommend to use a proxy.
