title: Convert *.ncm to *.flac
published: true

I believe that everyone who reads this article must have filled the Netease Cloud Music VIP. Otherwise you won't get the ncm file, and you won't be reading this article.
Some music you have filled up vip and download it will be the format of NetEase cloud music, which is the "ncm" format. It is useless after the vip expires, so today I will teach you to convert ncm files to flac or similar. The format.
First go to my website to download a tool.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orange2008/postitem/master/NCM-Convert-Postitem/main.exe
```
Make sure your operating system is Microsoft Windows, this program can only run on Windows 7 or newer systems.
Enter the following instructions:

```
Main.exe "Here Enter The File Name"
```
Then the program will automatically generate the file
