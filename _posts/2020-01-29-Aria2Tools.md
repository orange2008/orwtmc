First you need to go to download it.[Aria2Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orange2008/postitem/master/Aria2-Postitem/Aria2_Tools.zip)

Then, run _aria2c_Run.exe_. You will see this icon in your taskbar.It called: aria-ng-0.3.0 Server v1.0

Now, the RPC server was done! Now we should configure the properties.
Visit the URL: http://localhost:8086/#!/settings/aria2/basic
And config the download path.
EVERY TIME YOU START THE SERVER,THE CONFIG WILL CLEAR!!!
My path will D:\srsto
You should config likes this:

I am the home network, using 100Mbps network, it even can download at full speed.
If you have a server, you'll see the user-agent is Transmission, so, you guys know what can you do.
This program can download http/https/ftp/sftp/ftps/magnet/bittorrent
But very unfortunately, it didn't support ed2k, but ed2k was already out of date, so it doesn't a huge problem.

Hope can help you!
